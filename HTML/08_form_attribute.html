<!-- 
The Action Attribute :
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.
In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data: -->

<form action="/action_page.php">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>



<!-- The Target Attribute :
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
The target attribute can have one of the following values: -->

<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank"></form>


<!-- 
The Method Attribute :
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").
The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 
-->
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get"></form>
<form action="/action_page.php" method="post">


<!-- The Autocomplete Attribute
The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. -->
<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on"></form>



<!-- The Novalidate Attribute
The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.
When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.
Example
A form with a novalidate attribute: -->
<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>


</body>
